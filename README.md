# SimpleCalednar

This application is my introduction project, getting familliar with the Android framework and Android Studio.

**This app is by no means a finished and polished work. Its a project that served its purpose.**

The end goal was to create a mockup of the standard Calendar applications we're all familiar with, and providing what is
essentially the basic functionalities such an app offers:

* Creating and storing events in a specified day.
* Schedualing a notification with a desired delay.
* The abillity to edit\delete events and notifications.

While also providing a semi-intellegent system to manage the data and ease user experience.

## What I learned:

* Creating and editing XML files. Using Constraint Layouts.
* Creating a basic database system using Room Persistence Library.
* Using System Services, and handling the Background Execution Limits envoked on API 26 onwards with JobService.
* First time using HashMap (although knowing of it for quite a while). Quite thrilling. 
* Using RecyclerView and RecyclerViewAdapter.
* Using AlertDialogs. 
* Implementing the MVC pattern with AndroidViewModel.
* Allowing a minor degree of user-customizable View.
* More basic android functionalities and features...
